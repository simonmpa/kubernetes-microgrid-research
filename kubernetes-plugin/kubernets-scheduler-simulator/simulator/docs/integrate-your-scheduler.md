## Integrate your scheduler 

You can integrate your scheduler into the simulator.

To add your custom scheduler plugins, see [debuggable-scheduler.md](./debuggable-scheduler.md#integrate-your-plugins-to-the-simulator).

Also, if you just want to use your `KubeSchedulerConfig` while using default plugins,
you don't need to follow this page. Check out [simulator-server-config.md](./simulator-server-config.md) instead.
